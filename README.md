# Text Editor (in Rust)

Tips for compiling & running:

```cargo build``` to only compile, execution is manual

```cargo run``` to compile and execute

```cargo check``` to test compilation with no executable


Goal:

- implement a basic text editor that can maintain saves

- can add text to the editor

- can delete text from the editor

- can move cursor around the editor
